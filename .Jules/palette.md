## 2024-05-23 - [Icon-Only Buttons Accessibility]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like 'Back' arrows or 'Close' x-marks) are visually clear to sighted users but are invisible traps for screen reader users if they lack `accessibilityLabel`. The default behavior often reads the system image name (e.g., "arrow.left") or just "Button", which provides poor context.
**Action:** Always attach `.accessibilityLabel("Description")` to any button that relies solely on `Image(systemName: ...)` for its content. The label should describe the *action* (e.g., "Close settings", "Back to onboarding"), not the icon.
